    Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

    You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

    Example 1:

        Input: [3,2,3]
        Output: 3
    Example 2:

        Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
        Output: 2
